## Exercise 1

*What's the value of using the here::here package?* 

Rstudio projects allow us to establish a fresh session (with its own environment and packages), and avoid having to set our working directory. 

The here::here package makes it even easier for us to work with Rstudio projects because:

1. It helps us to find the underlying root directory that our project is located in
2. It helps us to get around the problem of working with different OS: different OS have different ways of writing file pathways - so if you are using a mac but your collaborator is using windows, they will not be able to run your scripts. 

In other words, one of the biggest benefits of using R is that it makes your code more replicable regardless of which computer or R session it is running in.
